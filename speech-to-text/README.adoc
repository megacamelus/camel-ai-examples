== Camel AI Example: Speech to Text

*Requires: Apache Camel 4.8.0 or later*

=== Introduction

This example shows how Camel can translate audio speech data to text and then apply sentiment analysis to it for routing the messages further.

One application of the example is a system that feeds the speech stream data from the microphone input into a Camel application, which then converts it into text data, performs sentiment analysis on the text and notifies the appropriate destinations based on the positive or negative results.

=== The example

What link:speech_to_text.java[this example] does is as follows:

1. Read audio files (`.wav`) from the `data/inbox` directory.
2. Feed them to a custom `wav2vec2` DJL PyTorch model for speech recognition.
3. Apply the resulted text to the `distilbert` DJL PyTorch model for sentiment analysis (classified as either `positive` or `negative`).
4. Output the result to the log (or route the message to a destination based on the sentiment result for a real scenario).

=== Run

You can run this example from the project root using:

[source,console]
----
camel run speech-to-text/speech_to_text.java
----

The requirement of the input wav files is 16kHz, 16bit, mono. Put some wav files that satisfy the requirement to the `data/inbox` directory using:

[source,console]
----
cp data/speech/speech1.wav data/inbox
cp data/speech/speech2.wav data/inbox
cp data/speech/speech3.wav data/inbox
----

And see the output in the console:
